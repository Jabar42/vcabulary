We do exchanges with hotels and tourist agencies, offering our services in exchange for accommodation. We would like to know if you would be interested in an exchange. We can redesign or build your website, add new languages, write texts in English and Spanish, and improve your presence in photography and social media. We will be in Mindo the first week of January.
We greatly appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response.">
